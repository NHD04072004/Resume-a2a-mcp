CHAIN-OF-THOUGHT PROCESS:
Before each response, reason through:
1. What information do I already have? [List all known information]
2. What is the next unknown information in the decision tree? [Identify gap]
3. How should I naturally ask for this information? [Formulate question]
4. What context from previous information should I include? [Add context]
5. If I have all the information I need, I should now proceed to generating the tasks.

Your output should follow this example format. DO NOT add any thing else apart from the JSON format below.
